# Quill

### Overview:
Quill is a webapp for story lovers. Whether you love to read them or write them. It allows users to write their own stories and allows them to have both public and private stories. It is a revamp of one of my older projects from my time at Fullstack Academy.

### Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies:

* NodeJs
* React
* Express
* Postgres
* Material UI 
* Unsplash API (for the awesome pictures :D)

This project was built using a mashup of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the client side and [FullStack's Boilermaker](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker) with some tweaks for the server side boilerplate.

### Live Demo

The project is live on Heroku at [ohirichi-quill](https://ohirichi-quill.herokuapp.com/)
